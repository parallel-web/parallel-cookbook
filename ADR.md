## The SDK is bigger much bigger than the spec

The Python SDK is 120k tokens: https://uithub.com/parallel-web/parallel-sdk-python?maxTokens=1000000

The openapi is just 12k tokens: 10x smaller!

Although SDKs make APIs easier to use for humans, this doesn't necessarily mean it's also easier to use for agents.

## Most people read docs and ingest to LLMs

MCPs and agents are less common still
