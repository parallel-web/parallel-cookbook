## Contributing

Built something with Parallel APIs you want to showcase? The Parallel cookbook welcomes community contributions. Also ideas for other recipes are welcome. See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Machine Quickstart

For the quickest way to get started, we recommend cloning this repo and installing [our MCPs](https://docs.parallel.ai/integrations/mcp/getting-started). In particular, the "llms.txt MCP" is perfect to ask questions about parallel as it will provide the most comprehesive answers because it has easy access to all needed context. The other MCPs are a great way to experiment with our APIs without any coding required.
