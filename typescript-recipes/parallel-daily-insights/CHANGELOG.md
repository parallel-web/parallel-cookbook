# CHANGELOG:

- 2025-08-05: first version
- 2025-08-19: second iteration ([discuss](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1957705885767331987))
  - Daily cronjob seems broken, fix it
  - Add basis confidence and citations to each property.
  - Show feed per task (reverse chronologically)
  - Ensure to link to the github from each page
- 2025-08-25: Wrote blog, iterate on tasks and improve scheduling time

# TODO

- Figure out how to more reliably get confidence level to medium or high. Reasoning trace and source doesn't explain.
