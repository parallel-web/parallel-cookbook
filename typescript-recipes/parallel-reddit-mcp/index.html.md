PROMPT:
let's build a fun demo with Reddits api. I want to use ai to gather different perspectives from reddit and then create a report on the different perspectives on a question. idk. maybe I should just do it in a fun specific way like "change my mind" that always shows you the opposite perspectives. let's make a landingpage first. use the change my mind meme as a background for the transparent textarea input. https://a.pinatafarm.com/950x960/68934c52a6/change-my-mind.jpg this would be the way to submit your question. below, there should be a bunch of change my mind cards that each show a statement in that background. if you click on it, it goes to /result/{slug} for a given statement. for now hardcode it all in a single html file.

NB: the text for the meme should be in horizontally centered between 30% and 70%, at 60% until 80% of the height of the image

use style for parallel https://assets.p0web.com and use the cdn.tailwindcss.com script for styles.
