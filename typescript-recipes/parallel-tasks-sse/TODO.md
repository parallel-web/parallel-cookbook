- Improve the styling of the SSE app to align with https://assets.p0web.com
- The only streaming updates in sse demo seem to be "status" updates. We should expand this so that all event updates show clearly -- including the "message" text that shows for updates on pro + processors.
- It makes sense for the user to be able to click into a task and open up details, but only the JSON and Table links work. I think we should change the copy for the JSON column to "Raw JSON Output" and make it so that the Table URL auto-opens, or the content from it auto-expands, when a user clicks anywhere on the row
- Run IDs should be "copy"-able
